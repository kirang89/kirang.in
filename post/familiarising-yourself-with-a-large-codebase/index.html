  <meta name="description" content="I&rsquo;m sure that a lot of developers find it harder to read existing code
and understand the ideals behind it, rather than writing it from
scratch, themselves. I too have this same problem, and so started
looking around online as to how people have dealt with it. I&rsquo;ve compiled
some good answers from various sources, below:

Try and understand at a high level, what the purpose of the code is, and then identify the key elements/functions that help achieve this purpose
Try to read as much design and documentation about the project
before diving in
Try and figure out the relations between various components and then
draw/visualise an architecture diagram
Talk to authors and clarify things with them beforehand
Go through unit tests to get a high level overview
Start with the entry point in the program. This will in turn point
to what gets started and sometimes how things are linked.
Make small edits or bug fixes, then gradually build up
Keep notes. Don&rsquo;t jump in and start developing; it&rsquo;s more valuable
to spend time understanding than to generate messy or inappropriate
code.

Hope you find success after following the above tips :)" />
