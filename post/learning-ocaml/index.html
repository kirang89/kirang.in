  <section><p>Learning a new programming language has always been a fun exercise. It often provides a new perspective for thinking about programs and reveals insights into the design decisions and trade-offs in terms of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4">what is simple and what is easy</a>.</p>
<p>My first introduction to the ML Family of languages was through the highly recommended <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~873260">Programming Languages course series by Dan Grossman</a>. This course presents different ways of thinking about and writing programs using SML, Racket, and Ruby. As part of the coursework, I was introduced to SML and I immediately took to it. Its clean, readable Python-like syntax without the explicit type annotations of Java, despite being strongly typed, enabled by the Hindley-Milner type inference.</p>
<p>I recently started my sabbatical from work. Learning new things and the process of getting better at something always gives me joy. To that effect, I decided to learn a new language and apply it to solve some problems/puzzles. You know, just for kicks. With no AI-assisted coding of course. While thinking about languages, I remembered my experience with SML. This time though, I wanted to try out the more pragmatic cousin OCaml instead.</p>
<p>The language has been easy to pick up and the tooling seems mature. I&rsquo;ve started working through <a href="https://github.com/kirang89/aoc/tree/main/aoc-2024">Advent of Code problems from last year</a>. Looking forward to the journey.</p>
