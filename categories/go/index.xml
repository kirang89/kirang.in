      <description>I hadn’t thought about Go or even played it until recently, when a colleague of mine who worked at nilenso raved about the elegance of the game. He mentioned Cho Chikun’s book to be an excellent introduction when I enquired further. Given that we had the book in our library, I decided to give it a read. By the end of it, I was fascinated not just by the beauty and elegance of the game, but also the history and culture.</description>
