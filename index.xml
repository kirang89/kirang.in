      <title>What I Love About Go/Baduk</title>

      <description>I hadn’t thought about Go or even played it until recently, when a colleague of mine who worked at nilenso raved about the elegance of the game. He mentioned Cho Chikun’s book to be an excellent introduction when I enquired further. Given that we had the book in our library, I decided to give it a read. By the end of it, I was fascinated not just by the beauty and elegance of the game, but also the history and culture.</description>

      <title>Setting up Org-mode to run Clojure code</title>
      <link>http://kirang.in/post/setting-up-org-mode-to-run-clojure-code/</link>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/setting-up-org-mode-to-run-clojure-code/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to be able to store interesting clojure snippets in an org file and then execute and play with them without leaving the file. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll illustrate the steps needed to achieve the same. I am assuming that you&amp;rsquo;ve already setup Emacs with org-mode and cider.
First, start by installing the ob-clojure package:
M-x package-install ob-clojure  or simply do so with use-package:
(use-package ob-clojure) Now we need to let org-mode know to use a cider repl to execute the snippets in our file:</description>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/creating-a-simple-stack-based-language-in-clojure/</guid>
      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to build a simple stack-based language in Clojure. First, this is how the input would look like:
push 8 push 4 + push 3 *  This would be equivalent to (in infix notation):
(8 + 4) * 3  Here is a simple parser-cum-evaluator for the above input:
(defn parse-eval [string stack] &amp;#34;Parse and Evaluate the line sent and push result to stack if necessary.&amp;#34; (let [cmd (clojure.</description>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/implementing-norvigs-spelling-corrector-in-clojure/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to try something small in Clojure as an exercise, and so I decided to implement Norvig&amp;rsquo;s spelling corrector (which is an elegant Python implementation btw). Being a clojure newbie, it was a bit frustating to figure out an idiomatic solution, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve managed a decent implementation. It was fun! :)
(def alphabets &amp;#34;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&amp;#34;) (defn words [text] (re-seq #&amp;#34;[a-zA-Z]+&amp;#34; text)) (defn train [features] (reduce (fn [model word] (let [lword (clojure.</description>

      <title>Rationals vs Decimals in Clojure</title>
      <link>http://kirang.in/post/rationals-vs-decimals-clojure/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/rationals-vs-decimals-clojure/</guid>
      <description>Use rationals if accuracy is your main concern. For example, operations on decimals are not associative.  (let [a 1.0e50 b -1.0e50 c 17.0e00] (= (+ (+ a b) c) (+ a (+ b c)))) ; =&amp;gt; false From the above example, one can infer that decimals are subjected to Floating Point corruption. You can find more examples here.
 Rationals are slower in terms of operations on them when compared to decimals.</description>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/concurrent-prime-sieve-in-clojure/</guid>
      <description>While watching the Go Concurrency Patterns talk by Rob Pike, I came across a Concurrent Prime Sieve implementation in Go which Rob had claimed to be beautiful concurrent code. Curious enough, I checked out the example and decided on implementing it in Clojure.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by creating an infinite sequence generator(starting from 2):
(defn num-generator [out] (go (loop [n 2] (&amp;gt;!! out n) (recur (inc n))))) The go block ensures that the body is run on a seperate thread.</description>

      <description>While reading Masterminds of Programming I came across the interview with Alfred Aho and his thoughts about the design of the AWK programming language. I&amp;rsquo;ve always known about the existence of awk, but have never really felt the urge to dive in. Then I came across this sentence:
 If I had to choose a word to describe our centering forces in language design, I&amp;rsquo;d say Kernighan emphasized ease of learning; Weiberger, soundness of implementation; and I, utility.</description>

      <description>The following is a sane way of fetching data using a raw SQL query in SQLAlchemy:
query = &amp;#39;select * from books where author=:author&amp;#39; from sqlalchemy import text result = yoursession.execute(text(query), {&amp;#39;author&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Neil Degrasse Tyson&amp;#39;}) from collections import namedtuple Book = namedtuple(&amp;#39;Book&amp;#39;, result.keys()) # Create a namedtuple for each row books = [Record(*r) for r in res.fetchall()] # Using namedtuple allows you to access attributes using the # dot operator instead of relying on indexes for book in books: print(book.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just started learning Clojure using Clojure for the Brave and True and solving problems on 4Clojure. While doing so, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that a lot of problems that seem tricky can be quickly solved using clojure.core/reduce.
This post is an effort to document some snippets to demonstrate how useful reduce can be.
Reverse a collection (defn myreverse [coll] (reduce conj &amp;#39;() coll)) (myreverse &amp;#39;(1 2 3 4)) ;; (4 3 2 1) Find frequency of words in a string (defn freq [str] (reduce #(assoc %1 %2 (inc (%1 %2 0))) {} (clojure.</description>

      <description>Paper: Computer Programming as an Art Author: Donald E.Knuth In this paper, Prof Knuth tries to highlight what Art and Science mean, and how history has often failed to understand it. He talks about the etymology of &amp;ldquo;Art&amp;rdquo;. He mentions how we used science and art in the same sense in the earlier times, and how the differences slowly started evolving to the way in which we now distinguish science and engineering.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Mosquitto and MQTT in general. Something that is essential to prevent unauthorized access to topics is some sort of an access control mechanism. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll illustrate the necessary steps for setting up an ACL(Access Control List) using Postgres and mosquitto-auth-plugin.

      <description>Introduction For something as trivial and important as email, it annoys me that I feel uncomfortable with any client I use. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried the Gmail interface, Mail.app, Airmail and Mailbox, but somehow I haven&amp;rsquo;t found myself entirely comfortable using any of these. What I&amp;rsquo;m looking for is a client that is easy to shoot up, quick to navigate between emails and can entirely depend on keyboard shortcuts alone. In short email on the terminal.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every iOS app you build would require some sort of storage functionality
within the device itself, especially if it caches data fetched from the
network. &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html&#34;&gt;Core
Data&lt;/a&gt;,
an object graph management framework developed by Apple will mostly
likely be your choice in this regard. In that case, a tool like
mogenerator is indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/creating-a-mutable-array-data-type-in-sqlalchemy/</guid>
      <description>The problem with using the ARRAY datatype in sqlalchemy is that it&amp;rsquo;s immutable. This means it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to add new data into array once it has been initialised. Unfortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any good solution to create mutable arrays until I came across this snippet by Michael Bayer, the author of sqlalchemy himself:
from sqlalchemy.ext.mutable import Mutable from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ARRAY class MutableList(Mutable, list): def append(self, value): list.append(self, value) self.</description>

my Galaxy S2, here I was, pulling through the day without realising how
much time I poured into getting the latest Cyanogenmod 11 nightly
working on my phone. It took patience, some restarts, some flashings,
some more restarts, and a plethora of network bandwith wastefulness, to
finally get my phone setup with everything that I needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mavericks(version 10.9), you&amp;rsquo;re likely to have failed in doing so. After
searching for a while, I found the solution that worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This post is the highlight of Raymond Hettinger&amp;rsquo;s talk &amp;ldquo;Python&amp;rsquo;s Class Development Toolkit&amp;ldquo; at PyCon US 2013.
Things to keep in mind while writing Classes:
 Inherit from object() Instance variables for information unique to an instance Class variables for data shared among all instances Regular methods need self to operate on instance data Class methods implement alternative constructors. They need cls so they can create subclass instances as well Static methods attach functions to classes.</description>

      <description>In order to facilitate an efficient collaboration amongst developer teams, it is very important to keep the development workflow as simple and straightforward as possible. Version Control is one tool that helps with this. Continuous Integration is another one. Below, I&amp;rsquo;ll illustrate the steps needed to configure a basic Python application with Jenkins, a CI server that automates a lot of the repetitive stuff, so that you can focus on writing code.</description>

      <description>We are slowly moving towards a completely api-fied world. All the common services that we used to find so hard to deal with a few years back, have become super easy thanks to introduction of API&amp;rsquo;s. Today, every other person/business out there is developing an API to make an XYZ service more awesome (and gain some developer love). Hence, it is important to understand the principles behind designing good APIs.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Making something complex so simple is really hard. And this holds true
even for visual design. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to screw up visual design and create
a mess, than you think. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight a few points
about good visual design practices that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt below:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you love Python and love open source like I do, you&amp;rsquo;d probably be
open sourcing something new every day/week/month. Sure that there are
quite a lot of articles online that tell you the best practices of
writing Python code, testing, packaging, distributing etc, I haven&amp;rsquo;t
really found a good article that highlights what are the best
practices/conventions to be followed while building a full fledged and
open source Python application. So I decided to write one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/familiarising-yourself-with-a-large-codebase/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure that a lot of developers find it harder to read existing code and understand the ideals behind it, rather than writing it from scratch, themselves. I too have this same problem, and so started looking around online as to how people have dealt with it. I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled some good answers from various sources, below:
 Try and understand at a high level, what the purpose of the code is, and then identify the key elements/functions that help achieve this purpose Try to read as much design and documentation about the project before diving in Try and figure out the relations between various components and then draw/visualise an architecture diagram Talk to authors and clarify things with them beforehand Go through unit tests to get a high level overview Start with the entry point in the program.</description>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/deploying-a-django-application-on-elastic-beanstalk-using-s3/</guid>
      <description>This post was born out of the pain to get a sample django application, configured properly, using Amazon S3 for serving static files, to run on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I encountered many errors on the way, but finally managed to get a full fledged application running successfully. I am gonna try and highlight the key steps here to help you get your project up and running in no time.
First, create a sample Django project and a AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for your application, as per the instructions provided in the official AWS documentation.</description>

      <guid>http://kirang.in/post/jvm-profiling-disclosures/</guid>
      <description>Well, I’ve never actually given importance to the term ”profiling” till a few days ago. The real deal was that I was just too lazy to actually run a profiler and then to try interpret the stats and hopefully find the bottleneck in the code. So to avoid all this hassle, I tried to be careful while writing code to make sure I don’t leave any open doors for memory leaks or poor CPU utilization.</description>

      <description>Before you install Pylibmc on your machine, there are a few dependencies that you need to take care of, so as to ensure a successful installation.
Install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev Install libmemcached
sudo apt-get install libmemcached-dev Now you can successfully install pylibmc using pip
sudo pip install pylibmc</description>

      <description>I just stumbled into this talk about documentation by Jacob-Kaplan Moss and it was really an insightful look into how one must design the documentation for an open source project. Below is the gist of his talk:
Documentation is communication This is the single most important point that you need to understand. Documentation is not just written as a guide, but as a means to communicate with various developers and users across the globe.</description>
