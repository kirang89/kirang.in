      <description>This post was born out of the pain to get a sample django application, configured properly, using Amazon S3 for serving static files, to run on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I encountered many errors on the way, but finally managed to get a full fledged application running successfully. I am gonna try and highlight the key steps here to help you get your project up and running in no time.&#xA;First, create a sample Django project and a AWS Elastic BeanstalkÂ environment for your application, as per the instructions provided in the official AWS documentation.</description>
