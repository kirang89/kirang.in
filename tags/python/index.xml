      <description>The following is a sane way of fetching data using a raw SQL query in SQLAlchemy:
query = &amp;#39;select * from books where author=:author&amp;#39; from sqlalchemy import text result = yoursession.execute(text(query), {&amp;#39;author&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Neil Degrasse Tyson&amp;#39;}) from collections import namedtuple Book = namedtuple(&amp;#39;Book&amp;#39;, result.keys()) # Create a namedtuple for each row books = [Record(*r) for r in res.fetchall()] # Using namedtuple allows you to access attributes using the # dot operator instead of relying on indexes for book in books: print(book.</description>

      <title>Creating a Mutable Array data type in sqlalchemy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/creating-a-mutable-array-data-type-in-sqlalchemy/</link>

      <description>The problem with using the ARRAY datatype in sqlalchemy is that it&amp;rsquo;s immutable. This means it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to add new data into array once it has been initialised. Unfortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any good solution to create mutable arrays until I came across this snippet by Michael Bayer, the author of sqlalchemy himself:
from sqlalchemy.ext.mutable import Mutable from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ARRAY class MutableList(Mutable, list): def append(self, value): list.append(self, value) self.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know what the ISO 8601 format is, you can read about
it &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve probably tried installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library&#34;&gt;PIL(Python Imaging
Library)&lt;/a&gt; on OSX
Mavericks(version 10.9), you&amp;rsquo;re likely to have failed in doing so. After
searching for a while, I found the solution that worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In order to facilitate an efficient collaboration amongst developer teams, it is very important to keep the development workflow as simple and straightforward as possible. Version Control is one tool that helps with this. Continuous Integration is another one. Below, I&amp;rsquo;ll illustrate the steps needed to configure a basic Python application with Jenkins, a CI server that automates a lot of the repetitive stuff, so that you can focus on writing code.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back at September, it&amp;rsquo;s probably been one of the most happening
months for me in this year. Well, at least technically. I will try and
recollect some bits from the eventlog here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building an open-source Python application the right way</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you love Python and love open source like I do, you&amp;rsquo;d probably be
open sourcing something new every day/week/month. Sure that there are
quite a lot of articles online that tell you the best practices of
writing Python code, testing, packaging, distributing etc, I haven&amp;rsquo;t
really found a good article that highlights what are the best
practices/conventions to be followed while building a full fledged and
open source Python application. So I decided to write one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deploying a Django application on Elastic Beanstalk using S3</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/deploying-a-django-application-on-elastic-beanstalk-using-s3/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/deploying-a-django-application-on-elastic-beanstalk-using-s3/</guid>
      <description>This post was born out of the pain to get a sample django application, configured properly, using Amazon S3 for serving static files, to run on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I encountered many errors on the way, but finally managed to get a full fledged application running successfully. I am gonna try and highlight the key steps here to help you get your project up and running in no time.
First, create a sample Django project and a AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for your application, as per the instructions provided in the official AWS documentation.</description>

      <description>Before you install Pylibmc on your machine, there are a few dependencies that you need to take care of, so as to ensure a successful installation.
Install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev Install libmemcached
sudo apt-get install libmemcached-dev Now you can successfully install pylibmc using pip
sudo pip install pylibmc</description>
