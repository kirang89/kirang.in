I just stumbled into this talk about documentation by [Jacob-Kaplan
Moss](https://people.djangoproject.com/jacobian/) and it was really an
insightful look into how one must design the documentation for an open
source project. Below is the gist of his talk:

## Documentation is communication

This is the single most important point that you need to understand.
Documentation is not just written as a guide, but as a means to
communicate with various developers and users across the globe. And if
you think about it, your project is close to worthless, if you cannot
communicate effectively about it to your users.

Documentation also makes your project accessible to all category of
users, ranging from complete newbies to experienced users and internal
developers. And thus, documentation should be written keeping all this
in mind.

So then comes the main question "What to document ?"

## What to document?

### Tutorials

Tutorials provide the icing layer on top of the cake. A cake with a
creamy top is much more attractive and mouth-watering than a plain cake
with no cream at all.

In the same way, tutorials help your users to get a good feel about your
project. They can get to know how easy or hard it is for them to use it,
and also get a gist of how things work. So write tutorials to make users
feel comfortable with your project. They're a lifesaver.

### Topic Guides

There are two types of topic guides that you may be interested in
writing:

-   **Conceptual**:
    <p>
    Writing how-to guides (Stuff like how one can extend your project)
-   **Comprehensive**:
    <p>
    Explain important concepts and the "**why**" 's of your project. Why
    should I use your project ? Stuff like that.

### Reference

This section generally contains some advanced documentation like the API
specification, which are targeted for experienced users. It can also
contain some links that help in gathering deeper knowledge about topics
related to your project.

As much as possible, try not to auto-generate the documentation for this
section, because nothing in the end is more awesome that documentation
written and organised by people.

### Troubleshooting

This section should contain questions that pertain to the pain points in
your project and how to deal with them. Make sure that Q's you mention
in this section are actually FA'd.

Awesome ! So, now you may go write some kick-ass documentation !
