The following is a note-to-self checklist for web typography:

-   Limit to 2 or 3 fonts
-   Ensure good letter and word spacing
-   Take care of line-height
-   Make sure content is aligned (check line breaks)
-   Set proper typographical hierarchy
-   Differenciate hyperlinks appropriately
-   Resolve conflicts of contrast
-   Use tools like [typetester](http://typetester.org) and
