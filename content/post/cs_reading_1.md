### Paper: Computer Programming as an Art
### Author: Donald E.Knuth

In this paper, Prof Knuth tries to highlight what Art and Science
mean, and how history has often failed to understand it. He talks
about the etymology of "Art". He mentions how we used science and art
in the same sense in the earlier times, and how the differences slowly
started evolving to the way in which we now distinguish science and
engineering.

He then goes on to talk about how Programming is both an art as well
as a science. Prof Knuth feels that writing a program can be like
composing poetry or music â€” it can provide us with intellectual as
well as emotional satisfaction because it is a real achievement to
master complexity and build a system of consistent rules. He feels
that reading programs written by other people and recognizing works of
art amongst them provides the same satisfaction as well.

He highlights that programmers attain even more pleasure when they
accomplish something with limited tools. Though it does not seem to be
the case now(thanks to Moore's law), he feels that there is still
plenty of room for artistry. He encourages writing occasional "toy"
programs under simulated restrictions, in order to test our abilities
to the limit. He feels that doing so prevents lethargy and taking
trivial things for granted.

He concludes by requesting hardware designers and system programmers
to provide everyone beautiful programs to work with especially for
routine tasks, so that we become encouraged to write better programs
and derive a greater sense of pleasure while doing so.
