Making something complex so simple is really hard. And this holds true
even for visual design. It's easier to screw up visual design and create
a mess, than you think. That being said, I'll highlight a few points
about good visual design practices that I've learnt below:

<!--more-->

-   Help people find and consume the information within it with **less
    conscious effort**. This is desirable because visual thinking
    happens much more quickly than conscious, step-by-step logical
    thinking.

<!-- -->

-   A clean design is one that supports **visual thinking** so people
    can meet their informational needs with a minimum of conscious
    effort.

<!-- -->

-   The basic cause of messy design is slight, unintentional differences
    among elements. This causes your brain's visual processing to
    falter. First, your brain has to determine if there actually is a
    visual difference. Then, it has to determine the significance of
    that difference. Because the small discrepancies don't actually
    signify anything, you end up wasting your audience's brainpower.
    Strive for a **consistent visual style** where elements which are
    logically similar look similar to each other and look unambiguously
    different otherwise.

<!-- -->

-   Make **roles** like header and detail **obvious**. Making these
    roles visually distinct helps people find the info they need. We
    rely on headers to help us get an idea of what the document's about.
    We also use them to narrow in on the details we're most interested
    in. At the same time, we know to pay less attention to headers when
    we're going through detail text. Using size to clearly distinguish
    the roles of the different bits of content helps people efficiently
    direct their attention. They know what to focus on and what to
    ignore, depending on what they're looking for.

<!-- -->

-   **Size** elements consistently and provide strong contrast between
    elements with different roles.

<!-- -->

-   By **grouping** related content and visuals together you help the
    user quickly find the information he needs. To prevent confusion and
    frustration, group elements which are actually related. Leave much
    more whitespace between non-related elements than related elements
    in order to make the logical groupings visually clear.

<!-- -->

-   **Alignment** is crucial to giving your designs a clean appearance
    and to conveying organization. Slight misalignments are confusing
    and look messy. On the other hand, using strongly contrasting
    alignments can make your design more interesting and attractive.

<!-- -->

-   Center alignment often gives a much "weaker" impression than left or
    right alignment. It looks especially bad with many lines of
    text. Consciously using **different alignments** in your design can
    serve to make it look more interesting. It can also make it easier
    for people to find information in it by further distinguishing the
    separate sections.

 

Some good books to read on this topic:

    Holden, and Jill Butler
-   **The Non-Designer's Design Book** by Robin Williams
-   **Don't Make Me Think** by Steve Krug
-   **Visual Thinking for Design** by Colin Ware
