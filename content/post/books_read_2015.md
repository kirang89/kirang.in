 list. No excuses.*

religious scriptures. This book teaches you the need for thinking for
yourself.*

* [The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18154.The_Cuckoo_s_Egg)

 the inner geek in me was excited throughout the book.*

* [Zen Habits - Handbook for Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6056602-zen-habits---handbook-for-life)

*Recommended for: advice/ideas on living a minimalistic life. I'd been following
 Leo Babauta's blog for a while, and decided to give this book a read. Picked a
 lot of good things from here.*

* [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian)

 enthusiast myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this one.*

* [Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146.Masters_of_Doom)

*Recommended for: fanboys of John Carmack. It is a good read for any tech

*Recommended for: Everyone. My favorite book of this year.*

* [The Cuckoo's Calling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16160797-the-cuckoo-s-calling)

*Recommended for: fans of detective/murder mystery fiction. This was the first
 book of J.K Rowling that I'd read (apart from Harry Potter). Though it felt a
 bit draggy in the middle, things were wrapped up well towards the end. I'm
 looking forward to read the sequel sometime soon next year.*


That's it for 2015! I'm looking forward to read even more in the upcoming year.
