I'm experimenting with embedding kifus of my games using [gokibitz](https://gokibitz.com/). It also shows you the comments, if any, that people have made per move. For example, here's the kifu of a game I lost (*pretty badly IMO*).

<iframe id="gokibitz-r1kFhXXrE" src="//gokibitz.com/kifu/r1kFhXXrE" style="width: 80%; min-height: 500px; max-height: 660px; display: block; border: 10px solid snow;"> </iframe>
<script src="//gokibitz.com/embed/r1kFhXXrE"></script>

I failed to balance territory with influence, which my opponent took advantage of, as you may have noticed.
