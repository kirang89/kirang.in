My first conference talk presented at [Functional Conf 2018](https://functionalconf.com/)! Yay!

I co-presented this with my colleague [Udit](https://twitter.com/yudistrange). This talk is about our journey building a masterless multi-node distributed system in Elixir. It covers the problems we faced, how we dealt with them and the lessons learnt in the process.
