Looking back at September, it's probably been one of the most happening
months for me in this year. Well, at least technically. I will try and
recollect some bits from the eventlog here.

\* Hypothetically considering that PyCon India 2013 happened in this
month, it was a great experience. From attending as a participant last
year to becoming a volunteer this year, it's been a hell of a difference
in terms of how you would enjoy an event from a different perspective.
It was an awesome 4 days in Bangalore meeting new people, making new
friends, having technical discussions and the beautiful climate in
Bangalore.

\* [Pycrumbs](http://github.com/kirang89/pycrumbs), a repo I created on
github, to collect and organise some good reads on Python, made it to
the top trending repositories for 3 consecutive days, which made me
amongst the top trending developers for those 3 days as well ! It's not
so much of an achievement according to me, but it sure does feel good !
=)

\* I made my first contribution to [Gittip](http://gittip.com). I liked
the idea of thanking developers using weekly tips and thus wanted to
help out in their mission, in any way possible. I ended up learning a
lot about what an open company is and the pros/cons behind running one.
Also, Chad was incredibly friendly and helped me along the way in every
way he could. I sure do feel good about giving back and look forward to
doing more of that.

\* Well, I don't really know if this is something to brag about, but I
had to reject another good job opportunity. Though it's sad, considering
the fact that I do get such opportunities, despite me not being a
"rockstar" or "ninja" developer, it does feel good that I do get them. I
am truly grateful.

\* [Anand.B.Pillai](https://twitter.com/pythonhacker) (president of
PSSI) handed over the role of administering the [bangpypers mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/bangpypers). Well, that
came in from nowhere ! I'm incredibly grateful to him for considering me
as a candidate for the same. About time I started learning and improving
the Python community in India.

\* Gave my first [workshop on
Python](http://www.slideshare.net/KiranGangadharan/lets-learn-python) at
SSN College of Engineering in Chennai. It was an truly adventurous day.
I ended up having a short technical discussion with the HOD(Head of
Department) of CSE followed by a nice and fun filled talk about Python
programming language with around 30 students of the campus. I also made
a couple of friends down there. And not to forget the beautiful campus.
A day well spent.

**Here's to hoping for even better months in the future !** =)
