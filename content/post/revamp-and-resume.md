It's been a while since I last wrote anything. I've had a few ideas, but I ended up procrastinating and avoiding the work.

Recently, I've been thinking of doing deliberate practice to improve my writing, and this provided a good enough reason to break out of the procrastination loop and start publishing again.

Before writing this post, I revamped my blog by updating the version of Hugo and changing the UI theme. This blog now uses [my fork](https://github.com/kirang89/hugo-paper) of nanxiaobei's [hugo-paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper?tab=readme-ov-file) theme. It's as simple and clean as the [hugo-black-and-light-theme](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/hugo-black-and-light-theme), did not require tinkering to make it work with the latest hugo version, offers a dark mode toggle, and has out-of-the-box support for [giscus](https://giscus.app/) comments.

So, here we are. I'm hoping to write semi-regularly whenever I can.
