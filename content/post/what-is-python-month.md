This year, PyCon India is celebrating the month of **August** as Python
Month, with the aim of increasing awareness and awesomeness of [Python
programming language](http://python.org) within the student community in
India.

**How can you help ?**

Python month will be organised and completely run by volunteers, so
anyone who wants to participate is welcome to do so. This is a big task
to handle and therefore requires lot of volunteer support.

Here is how you can help:

1. If you are a Python programmer and please give a talk/workshop at a
college in your city.
2. If you are a professor or student, please facilitate the a workshop
in your college.
3. Help us in coordinating Python Month by talking to colleges to
arrange workshops.
