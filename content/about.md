Hello There! Iâ€™m <strong style="background: black; color: white;padding: 0.2em;">Kiran Gangadharan</strong>.

I currently work at [nilenso](https://nilenso.com/) as a polyglot programmer exploring new challenges.

When I'm not writing code, I usually read books or play/read/watch Go.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kirang89), peruse my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kirang89), see my reading list on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24562454-kiran-gangadharan), and watch/review my games on [OGS](https://online-go.com/player/501498/).
