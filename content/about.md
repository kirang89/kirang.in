Hi! Iâ€™m <strong style="background: black; color: white;padding: 0.2em;">Kiran</strong> ðŸ‘‹

I currently work at [nilenso](https://nilenso.com/) as a polyglot engineer consulting with different organisations and solving diverse challenges.

I contain multitudes: parent, engineer, reader, photographer to name a few. My interests keep shifting, and I get immense satisfaction from the process of learning something new.

I've been trying (and _failing_) to write mostly about whatever I fancy, or want to learn better.

Lately, I've been working on improving my photography skills (read pointing my Pixel phone at random things). You can find some of my shots [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/pmsJpH4YEvRXM9Zu7).
